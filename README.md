# Weasel VGA

## I'm sorry... what?

The weasels like the standard VGA palette. They would like to communicate its contents, but despite many attempts
this has been interpreted as series of loud and aggressive hissing noises.

This repository provides an example excerpt of a dialogue between two weasels and a decoder to interpret it as
the standard VGA palette as a series of 8-bit integers, 0 - 255. The palette consists of 256 colors so the total
length is 768.

## Why?

The weasels are not at liberty to divulge this information at this time.
